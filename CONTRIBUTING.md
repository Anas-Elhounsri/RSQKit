# Contribution guidelines

## How to contribute 

You can create new pages or report errors or typos in two ways:
 - Open a pull request
 - Open an issue with the type of content you would like to see in RSQKit
 
 <!-- Not yet ready: - Use the GitHub web interface ([How to contribute](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/how_to_contribute))-->

### Reporting a bug or a typo 

Bugs or remarks are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/RSQKit/issues). You can create an issue and a reviewer will assign a label for it.
