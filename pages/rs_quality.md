title: Research Software Quality
---

This section is focused on the definition and assessment of research software quality, keeping in mind that quality standards vary depending on the software’s purpose. Metrics such as community involvement, code updates, and testing practices are useful indicators, but they only provide indirect insights into software quality, which is often subjective and context-dependent. Moreover, it should be further clarified that we recognise the challenge of balancing the software’s "fit for purpose" with broader goals like reusability and long-term sustainability, noting also the non-linear relationship between quality, impact, and the potential for unintended uses.

Beyond strict technical aspects of research software quality, this page will also address additional factors that influence research software excellence, such as assessing the software's FAIRness, the Open Source nature of projects and their sustainability.
