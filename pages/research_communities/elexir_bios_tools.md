**bio.tools** is a crucial resource for the life sciences community (part of the life science research infrustructure), acting as a comprehensive directory of tools and services in the research field of bioinformatics and computational biology. It is a collaborative platform developped to address the diverse and rapidly evolving needs of researchers in these fields, providing easy access to high-quality software and workflows.

The bio.tools platform supports a wide range of research areas, including genomics, proteomics, systems biology, and more. By enabling the discovery and comparison of tools based on their functionality, technical specifications, and relevant metadata, bio.tools facilitates reproducibility and efficiency in research practices. 

The platform is a collective effort by a global community of contributors and users, ensuring its content remains up-to-date and reflective of cutting-edge developments in bioinformatics. bio.tools helps reduce redundancy in tool development and promotes interoperability and standardization across research environments.

Bio.tools also aligns closely with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, ensuring that the tools indexed on the platform can be easily located, understood, and applied by researchers, offering them a comprehensive metadata for the research software available in the directory. This alignment makes bio.tools a key enabler of open science in the life sciences domain.

## Services
