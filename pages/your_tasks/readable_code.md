## Why does code readability matter?

## Why is it important to make your code readable?

**Code readability** contributes to the *accessibility* of your code (the "A" in the [FAIR reseach software principles][fair-rs-principles][^1]) - 
once people freely, legally and easily obtain a copy your software - they need to be able to read and understand it to reuse and extend it. 
So, readable code helps create more reusable scientific software and can empower collaboration between researchers.

In order to develop readable code, we should ask ourselves: "If I re-read this piece of code in fifteen days or one year, will I be able to understand 
what I have done and why?" 
Or: "If a new person who has just joined the project reads my code, will they be able to understand what I have written?"

In addition, software requirements will likely change over time because software is dynamic in nature as it interacts with the real world which changes. 
When these requirements change, a developer (who is not necessarily the same person who wrote the original code) must make changes to the software. 
They do this by reading the original code to understand it and identify what needs to change. 
Readable code facilitates the reading and understanding of the code, and thereby the evolution of the codebase. 
Readable code saves future developers' time and effort.
