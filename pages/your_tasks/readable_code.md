## Why is it important to make your code readable?

Copyright allows a creator to state that they own the work they have created. This declaration is optional - even if the creator 
does not explicitly assert it, copyright of the work exists from the moment of creation. 
A license is a legal document which sets down the terms under which the creator is releasing what they have created for others to use, modify, extend or exploit.
