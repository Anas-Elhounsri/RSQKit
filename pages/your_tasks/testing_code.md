## Why is it important to test our code?
 
- The act of writing tests encourages us to structure our code as individual functions and often results in a more readable, modular and maintainable codebase that is easier to extend or repurpose.
- Software testing can help us be more productive as it helps us to identify and fix problems with our code early and quickly and allows us to
demonstrate to ourselves and others that our code does what we claim. More importantly, we can share our tests alongside our code, allowing others to verify our software for themselves.
- Software testing improves the reusability of our code - well-written software tests capture the expected behaviour of our code and can be used alongside documentation to help other developers quickly make sense of our code. In addition, a well tested codebase allows developers to experiment with new features safe in the knowledge that tests will reveal if their changes have broken any existing functionality.
- Software testing underpins the FAIR practices and improves software quality by giving us the confidence to engage in open research practices - if we are not sure that our code works as intended and produces accurate results, we are unlikely to feel confident about sharing our code with others.
- Software testing brings piece of mind by providing a step-by-step approach that we can apply to verify that our code is correct.

### Considerations <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

* [Structured in bullet points](style_guide#text) as much as possible, detailing things to consider about this problem in order to be able to find the right solution.

### Solutions <!-- do not delete this heading and write your text below it -->

By using [bullet point style](style_guide#text) as much as possible, try to describe when, why and for what is best to use a specific tool or resource. 
Avoid making long list of links to tools and resources.
Make sure to add the tools and resources mentioned in the text in the main "tools and resources" table.

* Bullet point solution 1
  * Sub-point
* Bullet point solution 2
